# Featured Image

* Automatically prepends the featured image to your post content.
* Adds a meta box to admin, allowing you to disable the automatic display of the featured image. This allows you to set a featured image for the sake of OG tags, homepage thumbnails, etc., but not have it display on the post itself.
